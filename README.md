# Brownian Motion Simulation

This project simulates a movement of many particles(e. g. H20 molecules) that collides with a bigger particle(e. g. pollen grain). The movement is completely random(known as random walks).

## Usage

Compilation:
```
cd src
./build
```
Run(in src folder):
```
./gui
```
